        "#### **What you have learnt till now**\n",
        "\n",
        "So far you have learnt how to make LLM API calls in Python. In particular, you worked with OpenAI's GPT 3.5 models and the `Chat Completion API` to build a simple AI tutor.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, you went over some principles, techniques, and tactics for prompt engineering.\n",
        "The two main principles of writing a good prompt:\n",
        "1.  Providing clear instructions,\n",
        "2.  Enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under providing clear instructions, you learnt how to structure the body of a prompt through 5 components - **Task, Role, Context, Guidelines and Output Format**.\n",
        "\n",
        "You also understood that providing a very clear syntax and conditioning on good performance can get you closer to the desired output.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, under enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, you learnt two specific techniques -\n",
        "(i) Chain-of-Thought prompting,\n",
        "(ii) Few-Shot prompting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under chain-of-thought prompting, you essentially enable the LLM to work through the solution step-by-step and in few-shot prompting, you provide relevant examples of how you want the outputs to look like. So now you could structure your prompts into proper components and provide clear chain-of-thought instructions along with relevant examples of ideal inputs and outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "You also learnt some advanced prompting techniques like self-consistency and ReAct prompting. Self-consistency is basically the technique where you ensemble multiple attempts and select the most consistent output out of them. And in ReAct prompting, you enable the LLM to reason out a scenario and act based on some examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, you looked at some examples of how you can design LLM-based systems. Apart from prompting techniques, you understood that designing a LLM-based system also requires a safe design, i.e., the capabilities to detect and respond to unsafe user queries and prompt injections. You looked at the moderation API offered by OpenAI that can help you design such safer systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "With all of these learnings, letâ€™s now get started on designing our first LLM application - ShopAssist AI."
